Build
-----

Before you start, make sure you have a C++11-compatible compiler (GCC >=
4.7 is recommended), as well as CMake >=2.8.8, and the libraries and
header files for valgrind,zlib, and Berkeley DB.  We are using the gcc 4.7
in devtoolset-1.1.

On CentOS, `yum install valgrind-devel zlib-devel libdb-devel`

On Ubuntu, `apt-get install valgrind zlib1g-dev libdb-dev`

You can set the compiler by passing `--cc` and `--cxx` to the script, to
select one that's new enough.  The default is `scripts/make.mysql.bash
--cc=gcc47 --cxx=g++47`, which may not exist on your system.

We use gcc from devtoolset-1.1 on CentOS 5.9 for builds.

To build a complete set of Percona Server and TokuDB, follow the instructions at
[build a debug environment][howtobuild].
