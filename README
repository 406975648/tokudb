The Tokutek hot backup library intercepts system calls that write files and duplicates the writes on backup files. It does this while copying files to the backup directory.  There are two technical issues to solve.

First, the hot backup library must be loaded into the mysql server so that it can intercept system calls.  We use LD_PRELOAD to solve the system call intercept problem.  The hot backup library is preloaded into the mysqld process so that it can intercept the system calls.

Second, there must be a user interface that can be used to start a backup, track its progress, and determine whether or not the backup succeeded.  We use a plugin that kicks off a backup as a side effectof setting a session variable that the plugin creates.

Here are some details on how to use this plugin to run Tokutek hot backup.

1. Init mysqld
$ scripts/mysql_install_db

2. Run mysqld with the hot backup library (should exist in the lib directory)
$ LD_PRELOAD=PATH_TO_WHERE_HOT_BACKUP_LIVES/libHotBackup.so ./mysqld_safe

3. Install the backup plugin (should exist in the lib/mysql/plugin directory)
mysql> install plugin tokudb_backup soname 'tokubackup.so';

4. Check out the backup variables
mysql> show variables like 'tokudb_backup%';

5. Backup to /tmp/backup1047 directory.  This blocks until the backup is complete.
mysql> set tokudb_backup_dir="/tmp/backup1047";

6. Check if the backup worked
msyql> select @@tokudb_backup_last_error, @@tokudb_backup_last_error_string;

7. Work to do
- Make binary packages
- Add versions to library names
- Hack mysqld_safe to auto preload the hot backup lib if it finds one
- Run with valgrind and fix memory leaks
