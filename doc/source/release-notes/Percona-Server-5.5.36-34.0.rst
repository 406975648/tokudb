==============================
 |Percona Server| 5.5.36-34.0 
==============================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona Server| 5.5.36-34.0 on March 10th, 2014. Downloads are available `here <http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.5/Percona-Server-5.5.36-34.0/>`_ and from the :doc:`Percona Software Repositories </installation>`.

Based on `MySQL 5.5.36 <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-36.html>`_, including all the bug fixes in it, |Percona Server| 5.5.36-34.0 is now the current stable release in the 5.5 series. All of |Percona|'s software is open-source and free, all the details of the release can be found in the `5.5.36-34.0 milestone at Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/percona-server/+milestone/5.5.36-34.0>`_. 

New Features
============
 
 *Debian* and *Ubuntu* packaging has been reworked to meet the packaging standards.

 :ref:`mysqlbinlog_change_db` has been ported from |Percona Server| 5.1.

 |Percona Server| has implemented :ref:`slowlog_rotation` feature to provide users with better control of slow query log disk space usage.

 In order to comply with Linux distribution packaging standards |Percona|'s version of ``libmysqlclient`` has been renamed to ``libperconaserver``. The old name was conflicting with the upstream ``libmysqlclient``. Except for packaging, ``libmysqlclient`` and ``libperconaserverclient`` of the same version do not have any differences. Users wishing to continue using ``libmysqlclient`` will have to install the corresponding package of their distribution, such as ``mysql-lib`` for *CentOS* and ``libmysqlclient18`` for *Ubuntu*/*Debian*. Users wishing to build software against ``libperconaserverclient`` should install ``libperconaserverclient-dev`` package. An old version of  Percona-built ``libmysqlclient`` will be available for `download <http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.5/Percona-Server-5.5.35-rel33.0/deb/>`_.

Bugs Fixed
==========

 The |XtraDB| version number in ``univ.i`` was incorrect. Bug fixed :bug:`1277383`.
