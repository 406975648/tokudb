Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

 Percona Server 5.6.44-85.0-1 Debian/Ubuntu packages would reset the root
 password to an empty string during the upgrade on Debian/Ubuntu. This fixes
 the `CVE-2019-12301 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12301>`_
 issue. Bug fixed :psbug:`5640`.

 As mentioned in the
 `blogpost <https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/05/24/critical-update-for-percona-server-for-mysql-5-6-44-85-0/>`_
 packages were replaced in the repositories after the issue was discovered. While
 CentOS/RHEL wasn't affected by the CVE, some users got the 
 ``[Errno -1]  Package does not match intended download.`` message when trying to install
 the packages  once they were replaced.
